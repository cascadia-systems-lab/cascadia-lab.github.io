# Experiments Index

**Active and completed experiments in Cascadia Mobile Systems Lab**

---

## Purpose

This index tracks all experiments conducted in the lab, their status, and key findings. It serves as a navigation hub for understanding what has been tried, what worked, and what's currently in progress.

## How to Add an Experiment

1. Create experiment directory following [naming conventions](../architecture/STANDARDS.md#naming-conventions)
2. Copy [experiment template](TEMPLATE.md) to `README.md` in experiment directory
3. Add entry to this index in "Planned" or "Active" section
4. Begin experiment execution
5. Update status as experiment progresses
6. Move to "Completed" when finished

---

## Search by Topic

*Tag-based navigation (to be implemented as experiments accumulate).*

### Tags
- `#baseline` - Initial performance characterization
- `#optimization` - Performance improvement experiments
- `#comparison` - Comparing multiple approaches
- `#feasibility` - Testing if something is possible
- `#debugging` - Investigating issues or anomalies
- `#scaling` - Testing scalability limits

*No tagged experiments yet.*
